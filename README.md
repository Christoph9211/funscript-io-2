# Funscript.io 2

I'll probably write a proper readme quite soon!

For now, know that this is the repository for funscript.io, live at (at the time of writing) [beta.funscript.io](https://beta.funscript.io). It's a web-application for two broad purposes: modifying funscripts and interfacing with [The Handy](https://www.thehandy.io/).

Funscript.io is built around the concept of 'micro-apps'. Current apps are:

-   Play Local Script: allows you to play back a .funscript, as well as optionally a matching audio or video file
-   Manual Mode: basically just a mirror of the buttons on the Handy, as well as manual stroke and speed sliders
-   Random Mode: randomly controls speed and stroke values within user-configurable parameters
-   Cycler Mode: an automatic oscillation mode to slowly increase, then decrease the speed of the Handy
-   Modify Script: a powerful, modular framework for making various tweaks and changes to a funscript file
-   List Scripts: a little utility that allows you to view the heatmaps of many funscripts simultaneously, sorted by speed (I use this to decide which funscript to play)
